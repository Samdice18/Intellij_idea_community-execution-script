# Intellij_idea_community-execution-script

I created this script so that i can be able to execute intellij from my terminal just like vscode
NB: it has only been used on pop os

1) to use this download the idea executable and place it under the ~/.local/bin/ sub-directory under your home directory.
  - cp ~/Downloads/idea ~/.local/bin/
2) Make the tool executable by typing the following:
  - chmod +x ~/.local/bin/idea
3) Finally, test that you can run it by restarting your terminal and entering:
  - idea
  
# USE:

you can run it by typing the tool name and the folder or file you want to open:
  - idea project
  - idea squidgame.java
